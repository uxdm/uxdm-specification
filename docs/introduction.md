UXDM (User Experience Description Model) is a DSL (Domain Specific Language). We created it to increase the precision of product design and design to code transformation.

You may ask where is the UI (User Interface)? In the UXDM definition, UI is part of the whole UX, and we should describe it with the product definition.
